# Facial Landmark Regression Using SIFT and Linear Regression

This project predicts facial landmark coordinates from images using **SIFT features** and **Linear Regression**.

## Features
- Downloads and verifies datasets automatically
- Adds noise and smoothing during preprocessing
- Extracts SIFT descriptors from keypoints
- Trains a regression model to predict 44 landmark points
- Visualizes predictions and applies color modifications
- Saves results to `results.csv`
